# Simple CMS

This is the quickest route to a typical Ruby on Rails website. Hit the ground running with Pages, Blog Posts and Contact Forms.

### Default Credentials

```
user: admin@example.com
password: password
```

### Default Pages

*	Home
* Blog
* Contact

### Blog

Simple CMS includes blog posts out of the box. Blog posts are associated with the blog page.


### Contact

Almost every website needs a contact form, so we've included one by default. The contact form is associated with the contact page.

### Menu

The menu is two level. Each menu item is associated with a page and can belong to another menu item. Child items will show up in a dropdown beneath the parent in the main menu nav.
